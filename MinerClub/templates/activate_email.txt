Hi {{ member.id }},

Amazing, you've activated your account for the {{ config['CLUB_NAME'] }}'s Minecraft Server!

To stop non-members from joining the server, it operates a whitelist (like a guestlist) that
only allows Minecraft players with certain usernames to join.

All you need to do to add yourself to the whitelist is to follow this link:

{{ url_for('minerclub.register', sponsor_code=member.sponsor_code, _external=True) }}

And fill it in!

This link allows up to {{ member.quota }} people to signup (including you), so feel free to share it with any non-member friends who might want to join.

The link is unique to you, so please don't send it around willy-nilly!

If you have any problems, please just the admin at {{ config['ADMIN_EMAIL'] }}.

All the best,

{{ config['ADMIN_NAME'] }}
