Hi {{ member_id}},

Amazing, you've activated your account for the {{ club_name }}'s Minecraft Server!

To stop non-members from joining the server, it operates a whitelist (like a guestlist) that
only allows Minecraft players with certain usernames to join.

All you need to do to add yourself to the whitelist is to follow this link:

{{ register_url }}

And fill it in!

This link allows up to {{quota}} people to signup (including you), so feel free to share it with any non-member friends who might want to join.

The link is unique to you, so please don't send it around willy-nilly!

If you have any problems, please just the admin at {{ admin_email }}.

All the best,

{{ admin_name }}
